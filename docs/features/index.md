## Core Features

### Editing

Fresh provides a powerful set of editing features to help you be more productive.

*   **Multiple Cursors:** Use `Ctrl+D` to select the next occurrence of the current word and create a new cursor. This allows you to edit multiple places in your code at once.
*   **Advanced Selection:** Fresh provides a variety of ways to select text, including word selection (`Ctrl+W`), line selection (`Ctrl+L`), and expanding the selection incrementally.
*   **Unlimited Undo/Redo:** Fresh has a complete edit history, so you can undo and redo changes as much as you need to.

### Navigation

*   **Go to Definition:** Use the command palette (`Ctrl+P`) and search for "Go to Definition" to jump to the definition of a symbol under the cursor (requires LSP).
*   **Position History:** Navigate back and forward through your edit locations using `Alt+Left` and `Alt+Right`.

### File Explorer

Fresh includes a built-in file explorer to help you navigate your project's files.

*   **Toggle:** Use `Ctrl+E` to open and close the file explorer.
*   **Navigation:** Use the arrow keys to move up and down the file tree.
*   **Open Files:** Press `Enter` to open the selected file.
*   **Gitignore Support:** The file explorer respects your `.gitignore` file, hiding ignored files by default.

### Search and Replace

Fresh provides a powerful search and replace feature with support for regular expressions and interactive replacement.
